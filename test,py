# 1) Find common elements between two lists 

list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = [2,3,5]
common = list(set(list1) & set(list2))
print(common)



# 2) Count word frequency in a sentence 

sen = "there is a cat and a dog"
words = sen.split()
count = {}
for w in words:
	count[w] = count.get(w,0)+1
print(count)




# 3) Transpose a matrix

matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
transpose = [[matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]
print(transpose)




# 4) Write a program that reverses the order of words in a string.

a = "a cat and a dog"
w = a.split()
print("The Strings are: ",w)
reve = w[::-1]
print(reve)



# 5) Write a Python program that removes duplicates from a list without using set(), while preserving the original order.

list = [4,1,2,2,3,3,4,5]
unique = []
for l in list:
	if l not in unique:
		unique.append(l)
print(unique)




# 6) Given a list of numbers and a target sum, find all unique pairs that add up to that sum.

num = [0,1,2,4,5,6]
target = 5
pairs = []
seen = set()
for n in num:
	c = target - n
	if c in seen:
		pairs.append((min(n,c),max(n,c)))
	seen.add(n)
print(pairs)
